### **Step 5: Test Your Contract**

1. **View your contract:**
   - Go to https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/
   - Search for your transaction ID
   - Find your Application ID

2. **Test functions:**
   - Opt-in to the contract

- `deployment_info.json` - Deployment details (after deployment)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Reminders

- **NEVER** share your private key
- **NEVER** commit private keys to code repositories
- Use testnet for testing, mainnet for production
- Always test thoroughly before mainnet deployment

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"Insufficient balance" error:**
   - Get more testnet ALGO from the dispenser
   - Make sure you have enough ALGO for transaction fees

2. **"Invalid private key" error:**
   - Check your private key is correct
   - Make sure there are no extra spaces or characters

3. **"Network error" error:**
   - Check your internet connection

4. **"TEAL files not found" error:**
   - Run `python final_working.py` first
   - Make sure you're in the correct directory

## üéØ Next Steps After Deployment
